         "Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week! I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that weren’t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking.",
